👉 Why 100% abstraction not possible through abstract class
Ans : We cannot achieve 100% abstraction using abstract classes because an abstract class
can contain both abstract and non-abstract (concrete) methods, variables, and constructors.
These implemented members expose some details, hence abstraction is partial, not complete.
